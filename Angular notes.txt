Framework: Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Google maintains it, and its primary purpose is to develop single-page applications. 
As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner.

Components - Custom html tags/element. (html, css, ts)

Services - Used to share info across multiple Components.

Directives - Used to create custom attributes. (<img src="") => src - attribute

Pipes - Used to manipulate info, which is present in the component.

Architecture:
For communicating from component(ts) to template(html), we will take the help of Property binding and vice versa can be done with the help of Event binding.

For creating scaffolded ng app:

ng new project-name.

For running angular app:
npm start/ng serve --open
